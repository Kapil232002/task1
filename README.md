# Python Data Structures Practice

This repository contains basic operations on Python's built-in data structures: **List**, **Dictionary**, and **Set**. These operations include adding, removing, and modifying elements, which are fundamental for working with these structures in Python.

## Operations covered:
1. **List**:
   - Adding an element using `append()`
   - Removing an element using `remove()`
   - Modifying an element by accessing its index

2. **Dictionary**:
   - Adding a new key-value pair
   - Removing a key-value pair using `pop()`
   - Modifying the value of an existing key

3. **Set**:
   - Adding an element using `add()`
   - Removing an element using `remove()`
   - Modifying a set by removing and adding elements (since sets do not allow direct modification)

## Example Code:
The code demonstrates how to:
- Create and modify a list, dictionary, and set.
- Perform basic operations such as adding, removing, and modifying elements.

## Usage:
Clone this repository to practice and understand how Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures work. This will help in building a strong foundation for more advanced data manipulation tasks.
